 - switched to py2exe for win32 builds
 - source distribution building works now
 - experimental pyglet audio support
 - TODO: fix py2exe restarting
 - TODO: fix lightgraphics mod

New Todo:
 - Expand test suite
 - Fix or remove broken unittests:
   - ServerTest - (Code is commented out and way out of date)
   - MenuTest - (It doesn't actually really let the menu render or it test it at all)
   - SceneTest - (Not implemented, is mainly blank)
   - EngineTest - All commented out
 - Move source code into a package
 - Rewrite setup.py and packaging code.
 	- Currently generated app bundles on osx are broken.
 - Move the game to using Modern style classes.
 - Replace pygame with pysdl2
   - Font rendering will be the most difficult part of this transition.
 - Port over the fofix mixstream code to be used as the Audio streaming code.
 - If we want to diverge from the original code a bit more I might drop the collada format in favor of the .obj format.
