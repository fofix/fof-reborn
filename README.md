# Frets on Fire: Reborn
A modern Frets on Fire fork.

FoF:R isn't going to be a radical change from FoF, but we want to bring the code into modern times. Adding features where it makes sense without going overboard. A common code library between this and FoFiX has been started which should help FoF:R to take advantage of many improvements that FoFiX has made since the start of 4.0 development.

To run the game you need to install the following dependencies:
python 2.7
pygame
fretwork - https://github.com/fofix/fretwork
PyOpenGL
Numpy
Pillow
